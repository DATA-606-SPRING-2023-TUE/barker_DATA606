## 1. Introduction

"Over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated every day.  80% of it is unstructured" (Vasilis, 2022).  Humans don't have 
the capacity to consume and classify all of this data without the help of computers.  One method that can help make sense of this
data is Named entity recognition (NER).  NER — sometimes referred to as entity chunking, extraction, or identification — is the 
task of identifying and categorizing key information (entities) in text (Marshall, 2019).  These tags can then be used to order
and classify data so that it can retreived when needed.
